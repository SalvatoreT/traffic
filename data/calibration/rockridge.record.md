# Rockridge baseline calibration record

Run: `cargo run --release -p traffic-sim --bin calibrate -- --area rockridge --period pm_peak --minutes 60 --scale 1.0 --seed 1` (about 5 s).
Reports for the final state (seed 1) are in `reports/` (all three periods). Every value below is an ASSUMPTION unless marked DATA.
Run-to-run noise from the chaotic congested regime is roughly +/-5% on completed trips, so single steps of that size are not significant.
Steps C0 to C3 were measured on the step B2 demand (before F); D, E, F on the later demand. PM peak, scale 1.0, 60 min, seed 1.
Headline shares are the four freeway shares, modeled (PM observed): Hillegass NB from freeway (47), Colby NB from (47), Hillegass SB to (68), Colby SB to (45).
Speeds are in m/s; multiply by 2.237 for mph.
Steps G to J were measured on the second calibration round: the figures are the mean of seeds 1 to 3 (PM peak, scale 1.0, 60 min). The state before step G is the seed-1 row of step F. Seeds differ a lot at the same state (PM removals 8 to 54 across six seeds at one setting), so differences below about 10 removals are not significant.

| Step | Change (before -> after) | Type | Reason | Completed trips/h | Gridlock removals | Backlog | Arterial speed (m/s) | Headline shares (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Starting point | | | 2853 | 764 | 47.6% | 1.17 | 10 / 21 / 23 / 24 |
| A | One-way gate pairs split the street volume by direction (each of an enter-only/exit-only pair within 250 m sharing a street name took the full two-way volume; offered 13,106 -> 11,482 veh/h) | BUGFIX | Double counting | 3139 | 644 | 30.3% | 1.37 | 21 / 29 / 20 / 30 |
| B1 | Residential default ADT 800 -> 300 | ASSUMPTION | 800 is a collector value; a local street carries about 300 | 3164 | 535 | 27.3% | 1.43 | 14 / 18 / 18 / 27 |
| B2 | Tertiary default ADT 5000 -> 3000 | ASSUMPTION | Remaining tertiary gates are hillside collectors; the counted tertiary Alcatraz (about 13k) is not representative of them | 3366 | 488 | 22.8% | 1.61 | 14 / 23 / 20 / 29 |
| C0 | Downstream-room check before a node crossing credits 2 s of leader motion (`NODE_CROSS_S`) | BUGFIX | Followers braked at the stop line while the leader was still inside the node: discharge headway ~3.5 s | 3359 | 467 | 26.2% | 1.67 | 9 / 17 / 24 / 38 |
| C1 | Lane choice by movement (left -> inner lane, right -> outer lane, through -> lane with most room) | ASSUMPTION | One blocked left no longer blocks all lanes | 3387 | 460 | 22.5% | 1.74 | 10 / 24 / 27 / 36 |
| C2 | Left-turn pocket (extra lane, 3 vehicles, entry blocked by a through queue > 20 m) at signalized primary/secondary/tertiary approaches (`POCKET_*`) | ASSUMPTION | Class rule; no OSM-derived flag (OSM lane counts already include turn lanes) | 3725 | 458 | 22.4% | 1.99 | 9 / 22 / 29 / 42 |
| C3 | Permissive-left sneakers: 2 per cycle on yellow/all-red (`SNEAKERS`); opposing vehicles that will stop for a yellow are ignored | ASSUMPTION | Standard HCM practice; [HCM7] is only partly verified in references.md, so not cited | 4120 | 316 | 20.9% | 2.19 | 17 / 18 / 34 / 45 |
| C4 | Uncontrolled junctions: checked, minor class already yields to major (`plevel` = class rank); equal classes keep yield-to-the-right. No change; test added | none | Already correct | 4120 | 316 | 20.9% | 2.19 | unchanged |
| C5 | Signal plans: `CYCLE_MIN` 60 -> 75 s, `MIN_GREEN` 10 -> 15 s. Greens remain proportional to the per-lane critical flow ratio of each heading group; checked all plans: arterial approaches get 55-80% of the cycle where the cross street is residential, about 50/50 only at 52nd/Telegraph, 56th/Telegraph and Aileen/Telegraph (ramp-fed cross streets). Shared controllers for signals joined by links < 25 m were tried and rejected (more gridlock): `SIGNAL_CLUSTER_M` = 0 (off) | ASSUMPTION | Less lost time per hour; the cross-street floor keeps ramp feeders served | (7331 offered) 5722 | 62 | 2.9% | 4.27 | 20 / 38 / 33 / 56 |
| D | Route choice: perceived-cost factor 1.25 on residential/service links (`LOCAL_COST_FACTOR`, config `localCostFactor`); tested 1.0 / 1.25 / 1.4 / 1.6 | ASSUMPTION | Street-hierarchy preference. Outcome was noisy: 1.0 gave Hillegass 19/41, 1.4 gave 29/54 with Colby SB 68; 1.25 is the middle value | 4269 (B2 demand) | 417 | 19.8% | 2.12 | 10 / 24 / 27 / 37 |
| E | Ramp trips with an in-area end: `ramps.localShare` 0.15 -> 0.30 | ASSUMPTION | Moves more freeway traffic onto Hillegass/Colby side streets without fixing routes | (final state) | 69 | 5.0% | 3.68 | 26 / 36 / 45 / 61 |
| F | `assumedGateScale` 1.0 -> 0.3 on all non-count gate volumes (residential 300 -> 90 ADT, tertiary 3000 -> 900, primary 14000 -> 4200). Count-based gates and ramps untouched | ASSUMPTION | Offered 8.5k -> 7.3k veh/h. Scales 0.5 / 0.15 gave no better stability | 5246 | 69 | 5.0% | 3.68 | 26 / 36 / 45 / 61 |
| G | Study area from five ordered boundary streets (Telegraph, Alcatraz, College, Claremont, SR-24 north carriageway), no outward buffer; links on a boundary street count as inside (`boundary` in the area config) | BUGFIX | The old polygon cut a chord south-east of the freeway and kept streets south-east of Claremont. Measured with junction joining off | 5660 | 43.0 | 2.0% | 4.62 | 27 / 46 / 49 / 60 |
| H | Importer junction joining (`junctionJoinRadius` 20 m): 76 graph nodes joined into 35 nodes (offset signal tags, offset T junctions, dual-carriageway crossings, ramp terminals). Dead `SIGNAL_CLUSTER_M` code removed | BUGFIX | Two signals 11 m apart each held one vehicle (Telegraph/56th, Telegraph/Aileen, Claremont/Forest-Colby). The first version, which rejected clusters with a one-way stub, gave 5774 / 18.0 / 1.5% / 4.52 / 45 / 45 / 50 / 56; splitting off the stub at Telegraph/Aileen made that ramp terminal one node and measured worse (noise is about this size) | 5470 | 29.7 | 3.3% | 4.05 | 35 / 38 / 52 / 50 |
| I | Re-route share per 60 s epoch (`REROUTE_SHARE`) 30% -> 80%; tested 10 / 30 / 60 / 80 / 100% | ASSUMPTION | Drivers with live routing move off a spilled-back link sooner. PM removals over six seeds: 51 / 30 / 14 / 10 / 7; shares unchanged within noise | 5775 | 10.3 | 1.8% | 4.45 | 36 / 42 / 48 / 52 |
| J | `assumedGateScale` 0.3 -> 0.35 | ASSUMPTION | Highest value that keeps PM backlog below 2% and arterial speed above 4 m/s over six seeds (0.4: backlog 2.4%, 3.8 m/s; 0.5: 2.1%, 3.7 m/s with 20 removals; 0.7: 124 removals; 1.0: 265 removals) | 5829 | 9.3 | 0.7% | 4.23 | 43 / 47 / 48 / 51 |

Tried and not kept (PM, six seeds each, removals / backlog / arterial speed):
- Signal green split by lane load (a left or right movement on a multilane approach gets its own lane in the Webster flow ratio): 33.5 / 2.2% / 4.00 against 30.2 / 3.5% / 4.06 for the plain per-lane split; AM got worse (22.7 against 14.0). Reverted.
- Signal phases by axis (approaches within 30 degrees share a phase, up to four phases) instead of two groups: 23 / 7.9% / 4.0 (three seeds). Reverted; a College/Claremont/62nd node still puts College and Claremont in one phase.
- `ramps.localShare` 0.3 / 0.45 / 0.6 and local cost factor 1.0 / 1.4 / 1.8 (before step I): headline shares moved by less than the seed spread (Hillegass NB 33 to 43, Hillegass SB 49 to 55). No change kept.

Hillegass against Colby (OSM control data, compared with the network file): the network matches OSM. Hillegass has more stop control (all-way stops at 62nd and 63rd, stopped approaches at Alcatraz and at Claremont/60th; two humps). Colby has an all-way stop at 61st, a stopped approach at Alcatraz and five humps. The model's expected delay per block is similar for both (all-way 6 s, minor stop 5 s, hump 3 s each), so the route split follows the data and no parameter forces it. The observed freeway share on Hillegass SB (68%) is not reachable with the general levers: even with non-count gates at zero it is 60%.

Other measurements (final state, PM): the model now saturates at about 8k veh/h offered (was 6.5k): scale 0.5 offers 8.1k with 20 removals, scale 0.7 offers 8.9k with 124. With non-count gates at zero (6.2k veh/h) the PM peak still has 9 removals over six seeds, so the floor is the count-based and ramp demand plus the junction bottlenecks listed under "What remains off".

Claremont Ave: checked end to end. OSM lanes (3 with one forward and one backward = a center turn lane, or 4 = two each) match the network: 1 lane per direction between Telegraph/52nd and Clifton, 2 lanes elsewhere, speed 25 mph, signals at Clifton, Hudson, Colby/Forest, College and 52nd. No missing lanes and no broken connection to the SR-24 ramps (Clifton off-ramp, Hudson on-ramp) or to College. The under-loading came from the 11 m signal pair at Colby/Forest and the ramp-terminal gridlock (step H), which held the corridor at 0.33 to 0.63 of the expected flow. After joining it is 0.54 (north-east bound) and 0.95 (south-west bound).

Ramp junctions: after joining all four SR-24 terminals are single signalized nodes (Aileen/Telegraph and Clifton/Claremont off-ramps, Hudson/Claremont and 56th/Telegraph on-ramps) with 2-lane ramp approaches at 35 mph. Mean discharge in the PM peak (seeds 1 to 3): Aileen off-ramp 584 veh/h (offered 656), Clifton off-ramp 914 veh/h (offered about 1,025), on-ramps 783 and 555 veh/h. That is 290 to 460 veh/h per lane averaged over the hour; the signal gives the ramp 30 to 45% of the cycle and the shortfall is downstream spill-back on Claremont and Telegraph, not the ramp signal itself. The remaining gridlock removals are mostly vehicles queued on the 4-lane freeway stub behind the single-lane Clifton off-ramp (26 of about 45 removals over six seeds at scale 0.3).

## Final state, scale 1.0, mean of seeds 1 to 3

| Period | Offered veh/h | Completed trips | Gridlock removals (seeds 1 / 2 / 3) | Backlog | Arterial speed (m/s) | Stable (D4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PM peak | 7523 | 5829 | 6 / 18 / 4 (mean 9.3) | 0.7% | 4.23 (9.5 mph) | no (removals) |
| AM peak | 7183 | 5764 | 7 / 2 / 1 (mean 3.3) | 0.6% | 4.60 (10.3 mph) | no (removals) |
| Midday | 4888 | 4447 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0% | 7.17 (16.0 mph) | yes |

| Headline share | PM modeled | PM observed | AM modeled | Midday modeled | Within +/-10 pp (PM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hillegass NB from freeway | 43 | 47 | 39 | 41 | yes |
| Colby NB from freeway | 47 | 47 | 39 | 42 | yes |
| Hillegass SB to freeway | 48 | 68 | 42 | 46 | no (-20) |
| Colby SB to freeway | 51 | 45 | 46 | 54 | yes |

Mid-block flows (median per direction of travel, veh/h, PM, mean of seeds 1 to 3) against expected peak flows (ADT x 0.09 / 2, or the TMC leg volume):
Telegraph 1201 N / 628 S vs about 1000 (TMC legs 1064/1093); College 267 N / 659 S vs 540 (ADT about 12k, not in the data); Claremont 345 N / 602 S vs 635 (14.1k ADT used in the demand); Alcatraz 653 E / 319 W vs about 585 (TMC).
The reports in `reports/` are seed 1 (PM 6060 completed, 6 removals, 0.7% backlog, 4.40 m/s).

## What remains off

- D4 is not met: PM has 9.3 and AM 3.3 gridlock removals per run on average (midday has none). Backlog and arterial speed pass in all three periods. `assumedGateScale` 0.35 is the highest value that keeps PM backlog and speed within D4; it is still a stability workaround and not an estimate (non-count gates carry 35% of their class-default volume). It cannot reach 0.7: at 0.7 the PM peak has 124 removals and 5% backlog.
- D5 is met for three of four headline shares. Hillegass SB to freeway is 20 points below observed (modeled 48, observed 68); no general lever moves it.
- Top bottleneck nodes in the PM peak (blocked lane-hours per run, mean of seeds 1 to 3) and what limits each:
  1. Alcatraz/Telegraph (5.5): data. TMC leg volumes of about 1,060 veh/h per leg on 2-lane legs.
  2. Claremont/Colby/Forest (3.8): model. Two-group signal plan; Colby shares a phase with Claremont.
  3. 51st/Telegraph (3.7): model and data. Cross street fed by the SR-24 ramp demand; green split from free-flow route estimates, which overstate Telegraph flow (est. 1,200 veh/h against 340 simulated).
  4. College/Claremont/62nd (3.3): model. College and Claremont lie within 45 degrees of each other and share one phase.
  5. Aileen/Telegraph (3.3): data and model. WB off-ramp demand from 2012 ramp counts; same estimate problem as 3.
  6. 56th/Telegraph (3.1): data and model. EB on-ramp and Telegraph through flow.
  7. Claremont/Hudson (2.6): model and data. On-ramp demand (936 veh/h) joins the Claremont through flow with a 15 s minimum-green cross street.
  8. 52nd/Claremont/Telegraph (2.6): importer and model. Joined two-node intersection with five approaches in two phases.
  9. Claremont/Clifton (2.3): data and model. Off-ramp, 1,025 veh/h on a single-lane ramp that widens at the signal.
  10. Alcatraz/College (2.0): data. Boundary gate volumes.
- Signal splits come from a free-flow route estimate at start-up and never adapt; adaptive or measured splits would help items 3, 5 and 6 and are not part of this change.
