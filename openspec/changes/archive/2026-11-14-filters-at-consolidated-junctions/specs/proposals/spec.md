## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-street filter candidates
The search SHALL offer, at each intersection where it offers a whole-junction filter, a filter on each single street when closing that street leaves at least two other legs connected, labeled "Modal filter on <street> at <intersection>". Such a candidate SHALL conflict with every other intervention on the same intersection, and a constraint profile SHALL apply to it as to the whole-junction filter.

#### Scenario: Four-way crossing
- **WHEN** candidates are generated for a crossing of two residential streets
- **THEN** the whole-junction filter and one filter per street are offered, and no package holds two of them

#### Scenario: T-junction
- **WHEN** candidates are generated for a T-junction
- **THEN** only the side street is offered alone, because closing the through street would leave a single leg

#### Scenario: Pilot limits
- **WHEN** the pilot profile excludes intersections with a bounding street or an intervention type
- **THEN** no per-street filter is offered at those intersections or of that type
