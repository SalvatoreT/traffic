## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Change from baseline on the map
When a scenario has interventions, the map SHALL be able to color each street by the difference between the scenario and the baseline for the selected metric, on a fixed two-sided scale centered on no change, with the direction of change conveyed by more than color.

#### Scenario: Adding the first intervention
- **WHEN** a user adds an intervention to an empty scenario
- **THEN** the map switches to the change view and the legend shows a two-sided scale with signed labels

#### Scenario: Reading one street
- **WHEN** a user selects a street while the change view is on
- **THEN** its baseline value, scenario value and signed change are shown as text

#### Scenario: No interventions
- **WHEN** the scenario has no interventions
- **THEN** the change view is not offered and the map shows the scenario's values

#### Scenario: Small differences
- **WHEN** a street's difference is within the noise band
- **THEN** it is drawn as no change
